# The Royal Game of Ur

A work in progress :)

## To Do

FEATURES
- Networked multiplayer B)

BUGS
- ~~Player color sometimes swaps or player icons are retained? Maybe fix by changing how player tokens are added/removed from tiles.~~
- Ensure tiles are only highlighted if the token they host has at least one valid move
